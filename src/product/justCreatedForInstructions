fileManager and fileWriter is where I'm trying to see how to record the game 

and at the bottom of GUI.java (right before main function is where I'm thinking of putting the class object function to record)


Adding the feature of recording a game into a text file. both record and replay are required

1	A complete simple game of two human players is recorded
2	A complete general game of two human players is recorded
3	A complete simple game of human-computer players is recorded
4	A complete general game of human-computer players is recorded
5	A complete simple game of computer-computer players is recorded
6	A complete general game of computer-computer players is recorded

all moves made by blue player and red player, and then once someone is won - declare the winner

/////

the record file can look something like this :




Game mode: Simple
Blue player: Human
Red Plyer: Compuer

Player   Moves

Blue     S : buttons[index][index]
Red      O : buttons[index][index]
Blue     S : buttons[index][index]
Red      S : buttons[index][index]
...
...
...
.. 

Blue won / Red won
